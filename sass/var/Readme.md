# theme-nTAP/sass/var

This folder contains variable declaration files named by their component class.

Notice that the naming of the files maps to the framework components. For example, Component.scss => Ext.Component.
and grid/Panel.scss = > Ext.grid.Panel.. This mapping is set up in the app.json file as the sass namespace. DO NOT CHANGE
THIS!
